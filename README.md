Wow, just walked out of Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning and brain's all tangled up, like sediment layers after an earthquake. Theater's still buzzing in my head, buttery popcorn crumbs stuck to my jeans—I'm a tactile map of my cinematic indulgence.

Tom Cruise really looks like a granite boulder that's decided it can defy gravity—a total geologic anomaly. There’s a scene where he climbs a skyscraper like it's a smooth limestone cliff and I think I left part of my soul perched on the edge there. My back is screaming like tectonic plates in collision from these theater seats. 

> There's this part, can't remember, something with a helicopter—rotor blades cutting the air like the Pleistocene ice sheets carving out fjords. It's ridiculous and perfect and also I think my soda tipped over during that part, so now my shoes are sticky and making squidgy sounds like wet shale underfoot.

I don’t wanna forget to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie later, maybe. Gotta see that EMP scene again, the way the screen flashed like a sudden intrusion of magma into a calm, ancient stratification of story layers. Also, someone's soundtrack was vibrating under the dialogue, like a rumbling subduction zone deep below the earth. 

Why was the villain always wearing sunglasses indoors? It's like trying to study mineral deposits in the dark—counterproductive and baffling. Faces were blurring together by the end, like when you're up close to different types of sandstone, and they just blend into one gritty whirlwind.

> Friend asked if I was gonna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the movie again cause last time we totally had a debate about rock density in 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮beds, and this feels similar, somehow chaotic and thrilling with points of hardness and light.

The plot twists were erratic faults, suddenly shifting the story. There’s one part I swear is held together with duct tape logic, like when you cobble together field equipment and pray it works. My thoughts are alluvial deposits now, rapidly shifting, trying to make sense of flowing action scenes and dialogue I half-heard over the rustle of candy wrappers.

Anyway, have to remember to tell her to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the movie and make sense of Cruise's continual denial of physics, he's practically a mineral specimen unto himself. Oh, wait, no—he's more like mercury, defying shapes, slipperily moving through plots hardly anyone can catch up with.
